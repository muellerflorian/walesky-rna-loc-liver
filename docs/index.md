This is a collection of analysis tools to study RNA localization from single
molecule FISH (smFISH) images. These tools were developed in context of RNA
localization in liver, but can likely be applied for different questions as well.

We provide different analysis workflows (listed in the banners).
For each we specify the required installations, and detailed Instructions
for how run these workflows and what results are typically obtained.
