# Analyze RNA localization in smFISH images from the liver
We provide an analyze workflow to calculate **spatial expression gradients**
in single molecule FISH (smFISH images).

Here we provide only a brief overview. A detailed description
with detailed step-by-step instructions can be found in the dedicated
<a href="https://muellerflorian.github.io/walesky-rna-loc-liver/" target="_blank">**documentation.**</a>


# System requirements
Analysis has been tested on a **Mac Pro (late 2010)** running **macOS High Sierra (10.13.6)**.

RNA detection in FISH-quant has been tested on **Matlab 2017b**.

Post-processing in **ImJoy (v0.9.93)** running on **Google Chrome (Version 77)** with the
**ImJoy plugin engine (0.8.22)**.

No non-standard hardware is required.

Installation instruction are provided. Installation time is rapid and requires only
to download the most recent version.

## ImJoy
The provided workflow requires the installation of the ImJoy plugin engine, which
has to be installed only once, which takes several minutes.

Installation links to all plugins are provided and installation time for each plugin
is in the range of several minutes for the first install.

# Demo
We provide an example data-set, with detailed instructions for how
data has to be organised. Then we detail in step-by-step instructions how to
perform the analysis.

Demo data also contains the expected results, which are obtained
in a few minutes.

# Instructions for use
The provided instructions for the demo data are directly applicable for new data.
